nice to have:
apt install gh git screen vim python3-venv lsof exiftool

if using venv, you will need these to be installed to install requirements.txt using pip:: needed to build python dependencies:
apt install python3-opencv
apt install libcap-dev
apt install libpython3-dev
apt install libcamera-dev

libcamera-dev could not be built at this time because it didn't know about the version of libcamera that was installed on my new Trixie, so I backed off and when with the system packages:



if using system
apt install python3-piexif
apt install python3-picamera2
apt install python3-flask
